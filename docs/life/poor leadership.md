### poor leadership

the situation is that the leader does have a pool leadership almost every place in the job. i don't like this
and will often try to adjust his idea or behavior, the result is he don't like me anymore and often speak ill to the big leader.  
write this just to talking about the subject: if you don't have a good leader, how to survive.

#### what your goal？

for me, i want to be the 3.75 and the promotion, if the team bigger and split to a new team, i want the hold the chance
to be the leader of new team.

in the past, i thought the more i express my options the better, so i always express as more as i can, but i found
that the leader or other developers think what's i expressed is nothing or just as they thought, i felt i was
little respected and even be stolen. so i changed, i would not express firstly or avoid expressing some times, just to see  
what's the goods idea they would say or what's the tings they would do. After a few months, they felt the change of  
me, and thought me in wrong state, and i become hate the team more and more.

Recently, i felt confused, the result is separate from my original goal. so i need a calm down to think about
how to survive and make it.

#### change

my goal will not change util i leave this team, don't talk about changing team here.

- be more active just like others;
- express naturally and don't avoid to do this kind of things;
- up manage

#### others
you can see pool leadership in many departments, specially in those kind of companies which is rubbish first but  
purchased by a big company and then recruitment more good peoples.

just this week, one leader stop his leader's speaking for his incorrect speak of a technology by saying "you shut up(你闭嘴)",  
that's funny enough. that's what i want to say but will not say.
